--  Assignment Operations Test
--  ==========================
--
--  There was initially a bug in assignment operations, in which the
--  statement f(g(x)) +:= y was interpreted as f(g(x)) := f(g(x)) + y
--  rather that t := g(x); f(t) := f(t) + y.  This program will test
--  whether that has been fixed correctly.
