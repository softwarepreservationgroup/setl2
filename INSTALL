Based on information from Salvatore "Toto" Paxia and the guide
https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/paige/courses/setl/setl2.install .

== To build:

Execute these commands in the top-level directory:

    ./configure
    make

(See INSTALL-Libtool for more information on configure.)

== To install (to /usr/local/{bin,lib}):

Execute this command in the top-level directory:

    make install
    
On Linux (but not Macintosh), it may also be necessary to execute:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

The compiler (stlc) and interpreter (stlx) communicate via a SETL2
program library, which by default resides in the file setl.lib in the working
directory and is created by running the command:

    stll -c setl2.lib
    
If desired, this library file may be placed in a different directory, in
which case you should either define the environment variable SETL2_LIB
to contain the full path of setl2.lib, or use the -l option to stlc and
stlx.

TO DO: How are the included packages and distributions accessed?

To test:

Execute these commands in any writable directory:

stll -c setl2.lib
cat > helloworld.stl
program helloworld;
print("Hello, World!");
print("2+2 = ", 2+2);
end;
<Ctrl-D>
stlc helloworld.stl
stlx helloworld
